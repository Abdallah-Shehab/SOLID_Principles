# Solid Principles 
<hr>
This repository contains a .NET application developed as part of the ITI Professional Web Development and Business Intelligence 9-month scholarship. The application is designed to demonstrate the application of SOLID principles in a software development context.

<h3>About the Application</h3>
<hr>
The application is structured to illustrate the SOLID principles, which are fundamental to designing and writing flexible, scalable, and maintainable software. Each principle is showcased through various components of the application, making it an excellent reference for understanding and applying these principles in .NET projects.

<h3>SOLID Principles Overview</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong>: Ensures that a class has only one reason to change, promoting modularity and responsibility segregation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open/Closed Principle (OCP):</strong>Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification, facilitating easier future enhancements.
  </li>  <li>
    <strong>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):</strong>Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
  </li>  <li>
    <strong>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):</strong>: Ensures that a class has only one reason to change, promoting modularity and responsibility segregation.
  </li>
   <li>
    <strong>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):</strong>: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.
  </li>
  
</ul>
